  #EXPERIMENT 1
  Aim: Hello World & Calculator Program

Apparatus: Programiz online compiler or VS Code

Theory:

=> Program 1:

This program shows how the structure of a basic C++ program works. The main() function is the starting point of all C++ programs. In this one, we’re using the cout statement to print a basic message: "Hello World" on the screen. The #include directive is used here to include the iostream header, which allows us to use input-output features like cin and cout.

In this simple example, we apply the standard cout function inside the main() block to output our text. At the end, we write return 0;, which simply tells the compiler the program ended correctly. This helps beginners understand how C++ syntax is written, how to compile and execute a program, and how to use cout for display output.

Basically, this is a clean demonstration of a typical C++ layout where we just want to show output on the console using a simple statement.

=> Program 2:

Now in this program, we’re working with two float-type variables i.e. num1 and num2 which are used to take user input. The cin statement allows users to provide values, and then we carry out the basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The two numbers are taken, then added (stored in sum), subtracted (sub), multiplied (multi), and divided (div). Each operation result is shown on the screen using cout.

We’re using float instead of int because float supports decimal values and helps keep the precision intact during calculations. The use of appropriate data types is really important so we don’t lose accuracy, especially in division.

This program helps understand how to take input from users, do basic math in C++, and show results on the console using output statements.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, we successfully wrote a simple Hello World program and also created a calculator in C++ that can perform four fundamental arithmetic operations.
